# VSCode Installed Extensions List

This repo is just a periodically updated list of my currently installed extensions

Each list when entered into terminal will install/reinstall my most recent set of VSC extensions if it should even become necessary

backups are created by running the script file in this directory:

```powershell
./backup.ps1
```
