# Visual Studio Code Preferred Extensions List

This repo is just a periodically updated list of my currently installed extensions

Each list when entered into terminal will install/reinstall my most recent set of VSC extensions if it should even become nessecary

It can be obtained by typing the following code in PowerShell:

`PS C:\Repositories\VSCode extensions list> code --list-extensions | % { "code --install-extension $_" }`
